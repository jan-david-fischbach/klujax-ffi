# End-to-end example usage for JAX's foreign function interface

This directory includes an example project demonstrating the use of JAX's
foreign function interface (FFI). The JAX docs provide more information about
this interface in [the FFI tutorial](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ffi.html),
but the example in this directory explicitly demonstrates:

1. One way to package and distribute FFI targets, and
2. Some more advanced use cases.
